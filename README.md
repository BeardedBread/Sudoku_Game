# About
This is just a Sudoku program written in python using the PySide2 library. It's supposed to be a learning experience
about the graphics system of PyQt.

## Requirements
Requires `Python 3`, `PySide2`, and `Numpy`.

Use the requirements.txt to install the dependencies.

## Running
Clone this repository and run the `main` file, once the dependecies are installed.

## In-Game Instruction
Mouse to select a cell. While a cell is selected, click on a number to fill the cell. X to cancel.
Keyboard can also be used.

Holding M while inputting a number will scribble on the cell instead, which is useful for making notes.

Have fun!
